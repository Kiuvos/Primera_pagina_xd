      <p>Aurora was born on 15 June 1996 in the Stavanger University Hospital in Stavanger, the youngest of three daughters to midwife May Britt and garage door salesman Jan Øystein Aksnes. Her oldest sister, Miranda, is a makeup artist and former teacher. Her other sister Viktoria is a fashion designer, stylist, and blogger. She spent her first three years in Høle, a small town where her parents had lived for 15 years. In her house in Høle, Aurora developed her taste for nature, singing, and traditional clothing, such as hats and long skirts. Later the family moved further north in western Norway, to a house in the small village of Drange, located in the woodlands of the Os mountains, a remote municipality in Hordaland, near Bergen and Lysefjord. </p>
      <p>Aurora has described this place as: "There are almost no cars, and the roads are small and bumpy, and there are lots of trees everywhere; it's very quiet, and the internet is bad." She has also compared it to the fictional land of Narnia. </p>

      <h2>Runaway</h2>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkOTg5MTctYjNkZS00YzIxLWEzMGUtMzNkZjE5ZGZjMjEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTkxMDU1Njg@._V1_.jpg" alt="Imagen 3"><i><small>Aurora, Runaway</small></i><br>
        <p>Runaway is her most popular song, included in her debut extended play Running with the Wolves (2015) and debut album All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend (2016). It was released on 16 February 2015, "Runaway" was originally composed for a school assignment when Aurora was in ninth grade. However, she preferred to keep her music private at the time she wrote the song. </p>
        <p> Lyrically, the song is about escapism and "realising you want to get home again." Aurora expanded that "home" for her refers to "where my parents are", which was something she reflected while touring. In an interview with The 405 she said: "It's strange how this song fits my life better now that I could ever imagine when I wrote the song itself. It's about how important it is to have a soft place to fall". According to Aurora, the lyrics "came out of nowhere" and the they became meaningful to her after she grew up. The singer has stated that "Runaway" is one of the few songs from her debut album to "be about her."The verses cover various topics like "climbing trees, painting pictures, and dancing in the rain." At the chorus of the song she begs "Take me home, home where I belong."</p>

          <p>She calls herself a "forest person" due to being surrounded by nature and her love to "climb trees", and being "isolated and hidden". She has also shown interest in the ocean since she lived close to the sea, and her parents have a sailboat. Aurora's classmates asked for more time than she was willing to give, and she instead preferred to spend time in the forest. She also claimed that withdrawing into natural spaces gave her time to philosophize and discover the "power" of her own mind. As a child, she was afraid of people who sought to hug her and disliked such a gesture in general: "I used to be terrified of people who wanted to hug me", she said. "I did not like to be hugged as a child. And I used to be terrified of one of my teachers at school, but then I met him a few months ago, and it was really nice. It’s weird how things change."</p>
